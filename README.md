## Who are you? 
Someone who loved using PS Mix & Fix from 2017-2024, and wants to continue using them in 2025 onward.   
Like many others, I used to edit photos on PS Mix & Fix until they were intentionally destroyed by Adobe.

## What motivated you?
* On Feb. 15th 2025, I was editing a photo using Paint.NET and I thought to myself:  
> "This would be SO MUCH EASIER if I could use Photoshop Fix again."
* Zero tolerance for greedy companies screwing people over for money.

## How can I trust you?
I understand your concern, but I promise you: these apps are *even safer* than the stock versions.  
I disabled all analytic code that tracked your actions when using these apps.  
Furthermore, I even disabled network permissions for both apps so they can't communicate to any servers.

# HOW TO INSTALL:  
[DOWNLOAD](https://github.com/PSFixer/PhotoshopApps/releases) the APK's on your Android phone and install them. That's it.

# Donate:
