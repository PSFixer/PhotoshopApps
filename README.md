## Who are you? 
* Someone who loved using PS Mix & Fix, and wants to continue using them in 2025 onward.   

## What motivated you?
* I wanted to use the Photoshop apps again.
* No tolerance for greedy companies screwing people over for money.

## How can I trust you?
I understand your concern, but these apps are *even safer* than the stock versions.  
I disabled all analytic code that tracked your actions when using them.  
Furthermore, I even removed network permissions so the apps can't communicate to any servers. 

## Known Bugs:
* (Mix & Fix) Renaming a project crashes the app.  
* (Mix & Fix) Deleting a project doesn't work, even though it plays an animation like it does.
* (Mix & Fix) Duplicating projects crashes the app.
* (Mix only) "My Gallery" page doesn't work with Dark mode, currently.  
* (Mix only) The titles inside the "View Tutorials" page are black when in dark mode.  
* (Fix only) There's a big white space on the "Preferences" page when using Dark mode.  
* (Fix only) Project names & thumbnails do not display at all.
